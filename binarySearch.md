## Approach & Efficiency

For this approach I decided to learn more about the BST and then decided to understand the data that was being presented. Once I understood how it worked I drew out the elements of the array and variables that would be needed. I found that there are Left and Right indexes that lead to the generation of the middle to be calculated. After this there is a comparison that is made to check if the middle value is the number sought after and if it is checked to see if the target value is greater than or less than the mid value. Once this is done depending on the output either the left index or the right index gets re-evaluated to generate a new mid value. The process happens again and again until left and right index are the same at this point if the value is not found then the algorithm should return a -1. One thing I did find interesting is adding a check in the beginning to see if the input being passed in is too low or high and breaking out in order to prevent unnecessary looping.

As for time complexity I am not sure I am still wrapping my head around that.

## Additional Notes 

- Originally did not understand where the code began due to ambigous calls to input and sorted. Figured out that the code begins at insertion sort and that input array goes here. The insert method is the one doing the actual work. Because of this some of the code may not be fully updated to reflect this but I want to make sure that the intent after the error was found is to start here with the variables used in the code challenge.
